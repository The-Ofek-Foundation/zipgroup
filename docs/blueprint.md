# **App Name**: LinkWarp

## Core Features:

- Link Group Management: Creation, modification, and deletion of link groups.
- Link Group Configuration: Each link group consists of a name, icon (with icon picker, preferably MUI icons), and a set of URLs.
- Bulk Link Opening: Opening all links within a group upon clicking the group (ideally in the same new window).

- Local Storage Persistence: Local storage integration for saving pages. Enables quick saving and retrieval without database dependencies.
- AI Icon Suggestion: The tool should suggest a relevant icon given the link group name.
- Theme Selection: Allow the page to pick its color scheme, maybe with a primary color and secondary color, or light vs dark theme or something
